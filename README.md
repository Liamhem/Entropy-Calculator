# Python Entropy Calculator

## Usage:


This simple Python program takes a password as input and calculates its entropy. Entropy originates from physics; specifically, the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the "randomness" of a thermal system. In a cybersecurity context, entropy measures how "random" something isâ€”in this case, a password. Passwords with high entropy contain a mixture of lower and upper case letters, numbers, and special characters.

### python entropy.py
As you might have guessed, your password should be high entropy.
